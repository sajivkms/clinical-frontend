# Top Drugs
This was a project done for some course
### Instructions
To get this project, clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/RepoURLGOESHERE top-drugs
```
Make sure you have Meteor 1.8 installed

`cd` into that directory and install the packages using
```bash
$ npm install
```
or
```bash
$ meteor npm install
```
Once all packages are installed, you can start the server

To start the server, run `meteor run` or `npm start`

If everything goes well, your terminal output should look like this:
```bash
=> Started proxy.                             
=> Started MongoDB.                           
=> Started your app.                         -

=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
```
From there, you can head over to https://localhost:3000, or the IP of the server that
you ran the `meteor run` command from.

Enter the name of a disease or type some text like `Bone` or `Brain` or `Lung`
